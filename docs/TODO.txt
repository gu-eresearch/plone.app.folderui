------------------------------

0.03 release TODO:
------------------

  Major priorities, goals:
    (1) global configuration
    
    (2) multi-set facets (more than one option per index either AND/OR
        within the same index).

  -----

  * Hookup view in available view methods in FTIs for folders, Plone site on 
    package install extension profile.
  
  * Configuration facets-by-path persistence (local utilty) and front-end
    config form view.  Global configuration should be simple, and anything
    beyond configuring site-wide defaults may require entering text into 
    a textarea in the form that is processed into by-path overrides.
  
  * More date range factory components and dynamic date ranges for more
    useful DateIndex based range filters.
  
  * FacetedListing provider/controller class should support facet
    configuration via BasePathRules and some suitable global defaults for the
    site root that is acquired by subfolders as default config.  Should have
    a simple integration test on portal, subfolder (use self.portal and
    self.target from base test).

  * Tests for multiset (multiple choices AND/OR within single facet/index)
    queries (and any fixes to query runner or listing provider if tests
    dictate).

  * Noscript HTML form submission UI for multiset queries within same facet. 
    This will be one form per page.

  * Need some UI tweaks to allow someone to both narrow their search in a 
    facet and change their search for a single choice in such a way that also
    is consistent with the plan for multi-set UI.

  * Omit from display empty facets with no displayed filters.


0.1 release TODO:
-----------------

  Major priorities:
  
  (1) enhance UI interactivity for multiset filter selection.
  
  (2) Global configuration of facets and a way to spell out per-path overrides.

  -----

  * Progressive javascript enhancements for multiset selection (integrate
    javascript from mockup doc, improve).
  
  * Persistent local utility stores site-wide facet-by-path instead of a
    transient global dict.  GenericSetup default profile should install
    reasonable defaults.
  
  * A simple user interface for configuring facets inclusion/exclusion by path.
  
  * Ability to configure an individual facet to display finite number of 
    facets.
  
  * Ability to configure which facets are contracted by default in 
    javascript display.
  
  * Consider whether any of the factory registrations would be better 
    registered and queried as named adapters (e.g. for IQueryRunner) instead
    of factories for adapters.
